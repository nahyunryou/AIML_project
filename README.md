## Competition

### Description
The competition we have decided to work on is named AI Competition for Predicting Delinquency of Credit Card Users (In Korean: 월간 데이콘 신용카드 사용자 연체 예측 AI 경진대회) and it is host in Dacon. Feel free the check it out [here](https://dacon.io/en/competitions/official/235713/overview/description) (in Korean).

### Goal
The goal of this competition is to develop an algorithm that predicts the degree of delinquency of credit card users based on their credit card usage data.

### Metrics
The competition results are evaluated using multi-class logarithmic loss. It's a classification problem.
